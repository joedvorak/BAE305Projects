# Formatting Help

[GitHub README.md Formatting Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
## Steps to create GitHub Pages
Simplifed for this class

1. Create a GitHub Repository
2. Create a README.md file for the project (this is your design report)
3. Click on Settings (horizontal bar)
4. Click on Pages (vertical bar)
5. Click on box under source and select main. Then click Save.
6. Select a Theme if you want.
7. Wait several mintues for the website to refresh. Click on the Pages link.
8. Put the pages link at the top of the README.md for easy access from the repository.

## Hints
- You can use the Wiki to build the Markdown formatting much easier. The buttons give you the formatting codes and preview lets you look at the outcome immediately.
- You can upload images to the repository and link to them there (or a sub-directory)
- Your programming code should also be uploaded to the GitHub repository.
